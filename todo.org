* smokejs roadmap
** Tasks for RC1
** RC1 reader facing requirements

*** TODO Make a dust filter to turn markdown into html
**** TODO Write tests for the markdown->html filter
     (if it doesn't exist already)
*** TODO Hook the markdown filter into our existing render function

*** Make splash pages like the homepage and special reports pages work
**** Figure out and implement the best way to get a list of lists out of mirrors to see what arrays need to be on homepage
**** Figure out and implement the best way of loading a lot of lists at a time.
**** Figure out if we must allow arbitrary HTML elements or if we can put that in a template

*** Make a list of all the different media types for our content, and make hivemind subclasses and templates for them
**** known media type photoessay, needs subclass and template
**** known media type blog post, needs subclass and template
**** known media type article, needs template

*** Make templates for asssets showing up not on a dedicated page
**** Mininav list is needed for inside article content
**** Article list for front page
**** Author featured based article list for front page
**** Way more. Find them and make them

*** Make the article list pages
**** Make the politics section page
**** Make the environment section page
**** Make the culture section page
**** Make a topics page

*** Make splash pages
**** Make homepage
**** Have a plan for how to make something like http://www.motherjones.com/special-reports/2012/12/guns-in-america-mass-shootings

** RC1 edit staff facing requirements

*** Make content editor
**** TODO Implement a save-as-markdown function for medium-editor
**** TODO Improve the insert image mechanism in medium-editor
**** TODO Make it allow for editing image URLs without the delete/re-add

*** Make asset editor form
**** Needs to either use the schema from mirrors-schema to make a form, or make a form for each media type
**** Needs to incorporate content editor

*** Make curation interface
**** Edit wants the ability to put what they think is important at the top of our lists of content. When they don't curate it should have sane defaults
**** This should include a datetime selector which ties into a scheduler on mirrors so that edit can (for instance) select the stories that will appear in tomorrows front page slider

** Nice to haves

*** Make even faster.
**** Preload articles on mouseover
**** Put content in localstorage
**** Examine the possibility of storing assets in localstorage
**** Find out if we get a speed win out of keeping article views around instead of trashing and reupping views
**** Look for bottlenecks using a firebug plugin
