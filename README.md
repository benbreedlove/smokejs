**Smoke** is a new front end for MotherJones.com.
## Installation
To work on this locally, you'll need:
* Node - The package manager installation instructions on [here](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager) managed to work for us.
* [npm](https://npmjs.org/) - Again, package manager version should be fine.
* grunt-cli installed globally
    sudo npm install grunt-cli -g
## Getting Started
    git clone git@github.com:benbreedlove/smokejs.git
    cd smokejs/
    npm install
